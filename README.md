# Cthulu
Cthulu is a learning framework to study polymorphic and metamorphic threat vectors.
This is not a "point and shoot" operable tool, it is meant to be a learning experience to explore new polymorphic attack vectors ahead of the trend and collaboratively start a dialogue on how to protect systems from these threats.
The code is at a basic stage and need some work to be usable.
Commits are more than welcome and encouraged as this project will only be successful with the involvement of the community.
